# PocketGM

## 1. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Discrete Chess Analysis System is a technical prototype that enables real-time chess analysis during over-the-board games. The core of the system is a mobile application that uses Stockfish for position analysis.

After entering a move, the Stockfish engine analyzes the position and sends feedback within two seconds. The goal is to demonstrate how mobile development and chess AI can be integrated into a working system.
